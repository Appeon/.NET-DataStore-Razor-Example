##### Setting Up the Project

1. Download the project and save it to your local directory. 

2. Open the *DataStore-Asp.NetCore-Example.sln* solution in Visual Studio 2022 or another C# development IDE.

3. Download the SQL Server database backup file from [.NET-Project-Example-Database](https://github.com/Appeon/.NET-Project-Example-Database), and restore the database using the downloaded database backup file.

4. Open the configuration file *appsettings.json* in the *Appeon.DataStoreDemo.Web* project, modify the ConnectionStrings with the SQL Server database connection information. 

   ```json
   //Keep the database connection name as the default “AdventureWorks2012” or change it to a name you prefer to use, and change the Data Source, User ID, Password and Initial Catalog according to the actual settings
   "ConnectionStrings": { "AdventureWorks2012": "Data Source=127.0.0.1; Initial Catalog=AdventureWorks; Integrated Security=False; User ID=sa; Password=123456; Pooling=True; Min Pool Size=0; Max Pool Size=100; ApplicationIntent=ReadWrite;Trust Server Certificate=True" } 
   ```

5. In the ConfigureServices method of *Startup.cs*, go to the following line, and make sure the ConnectionString name is the same as the database connection name specified in step #4.

   ```C#
   //Note: Change "OrderContext" if you have changed the default DataContext file name; change the "AdventureWorks" if you have changed the database connection name in appsettings.json 
   services.AddDataContext<OrderContext>(m => m.UseSqlServer(Configuration["ConnectionStrings:AdventureWorks2012"])); 
   ```
